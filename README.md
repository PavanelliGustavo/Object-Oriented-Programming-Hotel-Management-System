# Hotel Management System

A robust **C++ application** designed for hotel administration, featuring a **Layered Architecture** that strictly separates user interaction from business logic and data persistence.

This project was developed to implement advanced **Object-Oriented Programming** concepts, focusing on **modularity**, **decoupling**, and **industry-standard build systems**.

---

## 📖 About the Project

The **Hotel Management System** provides a comprehensive solution for managing typical hospitality operations. It allows managers to handle:

* User authentication
* Guest profiles
* Room inventory
* Reservation scheduling

All while ensuring **data integrity** and preventing **booking conflicts**.

The core engineering goal was to implement a **Service-Oriented Architecture**, where the **Presentation Layer** communicates with the **Service Layer** strictly through **abstract interfaces**, ensuring high modularity and testability.

---

## 🏗 Architecture

The system is organized into two main layers that communicate via well-defined interfaces:

### 1. Presentation Layer

Responsible for user interaction and data validation. It acts as a client to the service layer.

* **MAI (Access Interface Module)**  
  Acts as the central hub, routing the user to authentication, personal profile, or reservation modules.

* **MAA (Authentication Presentation)**  
  Handles login and registration UI.

* **MAP (Personal Presentation)**  
  Manages user profile updates.

* **MAR (Reservation Presentation)**  
  The operational core for CRUD operations on **Hotels**, **Rooms**, and **Reservations**.

### 2. Service Layer

Responsible for business logic, rules enforcement, and data persistence.

* **MSA (Authentication Service)**  
  Validates credentials and manages session tokens.

* **MSP (Personal Service)**  
  Ensures data integrity for user profiles.

* **MSR (Reservation Service)**  
  Validates business rules (e.g., date conflicts, capacity checks) and executes transactions.

## 📝 Note on Language

While the interface, documentation, and file structure are in **English** to adhere to global development standards, the internal domain logic (variable names, class names, and UI text) remains in **Portuguese (PT-BR)**.

This decision preserves the original domain language of the stakeholders and requirements for whom the software was initially designed.
